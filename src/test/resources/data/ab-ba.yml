  Ultra-wideband (also known as UWB, ultra-wide band and ultraband) is a radio technology that can use a very low
  energy level for short-range, high-bandwidth communications over a large portion of the radio spectrum.[1] UWB has
  traditional applications in non-cooperative radar imaging. Most recent applications target sensor data collection,
  precision locating [2] and tracking applications.[
